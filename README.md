# Hospital-Operations-Patient-Analytics
## Recommended Structure and Order
### 1. Short Description / Purpose
The Hospital Operations & Patient Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI solution designed to provide a centralized view of hospital performance and patient flow.

It enables healthcare teams to:<br>
• Monitor patient admissions and department load.<br>
• Track bed occupancy and utilization.<br>
• Analyze staff workload distribution.<br>
• Understand patient demographics and treatment outcomes.<br>

Built for: Hospital administrators, operations managers, healthcare analysts, and decision-makers.

### 2. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for creating interactive reports, KPIs, and visual dashboards.<br>
• 📂 Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, removing nulls, and structuring hospital datasets.<br>
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created calculated measures such as bed occupancy %, average length of stay, patient counts, and staff workload metrics.<br>
• 🧩 Data Modeling – Built relationships between Patient, Staff, Department, and Bed tables to enable accurate filtering and analysis.<br>
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard snapshots and documentation.<br>

### 3. Data Source
Source: Hospital Operations & Patient Records Dataset (CSV/Excel)<br>

The dataset includes comprehensive hospital information such as patient demographics, department-wise admissions, bed allocation and utilization, staff details, treatment costs, length of stay, and admission status (normal, ICU, discharge, readmission, death).<br>

It is structured to support:<br>
• Patient-level analysis.<br>
• Department performance tracking.<br>
• Resource utilization (beds & staff).<br>
• Operational efficiency monitoring.<br>

inside Power BI for real-time insights and strategic healthcare decisions.

• Goal of the dashboard<br>
• Walk through of key visuals (briefly!)<br>
• Business impact & Insights<br>

• Business Problem<br>
Hospitals deal with continuous patient admissions, bed allocation, and staff management across multiple departments. However, without a unified analytics system, tracking operational efficiency becomes slow and error-prone.<br>

• Common challenges include:<br>
• Understanding real-time patient volume by department<br>
• Monitoring bed availability and occupancy pressure<br>
• Balancing staff workload effectively<br>
• Analyzing patient stay duration and treatment outcomes<br>
• Turning scattered hospital data into actionable insights<br>

• Goal of the Dashboard<br>
To create a centralized hospital performance dashboard that:<br>

• Provides real-time visibility into patient flow and occupancy<br>
• Supports better planning of beds, staff, and department resources<br>
• Tracks operational KPIs for healthcare efficiency<br>
• Helps management identify bottlenecks and improvement areas<br>
